## Abstract
Generating Original Classical Music with an LSTM Neural Network and Attention : 
In order to do it, I will try to use LSTM and Neural network techniques. I think the result can be interesting, because there are a lot of source of classical music. 




## Model/Data

Briefly describe the files that are included with your repository:
- trained models
- training data (or link to training data)

## Code

Your code for generating your project:
- Python: generative_code.py
- Jupyter notebooks: generative_code.ipynb

## Results

Documentation of your results in an appropriate format, both links to files and a brief description of their contents:
- `.wav` files or `.mp4`
- `.midi` files
- musical scores
- ... some other form

## Technical Notes

Any implementation details or notes we need to repeat your work. 
- Does this code require other pip packages, software, etc?
- Does it run on some other (non-datahub) platform? (CoLab, etc.)
